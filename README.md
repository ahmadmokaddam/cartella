# Introducing Cartella

# At this time, Cartella is now deprecated. Cartella is replaced with a new, much more feature rich and less buggy tweak called Folded. It is available on Packix for FREE!

## Bolders for iOS 13 and WAY more!

We all remember Bolders, that awesome tweak that broke on iOS 13, which had made all of our folders look so good! Now, introducing Cartella, Italian for folder. Take control over the tiny details of your folders, and make them look BEAUTIFUL!!!

## Dynamic!
Cartella is (mostly) dynamic, so you won't need to respring to apply most options!

## Features List:
- Custom folder rows
- Custom folder columns
- Hide folder icon blur
- Hide folder background
- Pinch the folders in vertically (custom height)
- Pinch them in sideways (side pinch factor)
- Full Screen Folders (like Bolders)
- Hide the pages and dock in folders
- Hide the blur on the wallpaper in folders (I recommend you turn on hide the pages and dock in folders as well for this option)
- OLED folders (pure black background)
- Bold Titles (like Bolders)
- Choose the size of the folder title (Hidden, Large, Regular)
- Align the title to the left, center, or right!
- Close folders by options of tap to close and pinch to close (or both)
- Resize the Grid preview of the folder icon
- Hide all SpringBoard labels
- Hide all SpringBoard page dots
- Custom folder icon color
- Custom folder view color
- Custom folder background blur color
- Custom folder icon columns!
- Custom folder icon rows!
